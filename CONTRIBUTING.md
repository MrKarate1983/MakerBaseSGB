# Contribution

This project is limited in scope of contributions due to the nature of SGB projects. Because SGB projects are not 
conducive to version control, any contributors to the project will need to coordinate closely with the project owner, 
requiring any other contributors to pause work and allow for to be made and committed individually. At this time, there are 
no plans to add additional contributors to the project until / unless a method for managing merges and conflicts
can be determined.

# Contribution Requests

The best way to contribute is through feature or bug request, and direct coordination with mottzymakes@gmail.com. 
If there are enough requests, a contribution process will be defined that allows contributors to make branches that will
then be manually put into the master project. Contributors will have their scripts commented for proper attribution, and some
contributor scripts may become part of MottzyMakes tutorials. More to come here, if you have interest in having this process 
expanded, reach out!
